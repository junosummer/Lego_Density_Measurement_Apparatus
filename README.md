# Lego_Density_Measurement_Apparatus
Our Robot takes two very simple physical principles, Hookeâ€™s law and the Archimedes principle, and combines them in a density detector. We used a light sensor with a grey scale which was calibrated from previous experimentation to give a readout of height change. We implemented this twice in our project, firstly to measure the extension of a spring hung balance, and secondly to measure depth change in a water tank. MATLAB takes this and gives a readout of density. An exceptional feature is it transports the object through the process without external intervention. Due to the limitations of combining the Lego with external components the accuracy of the model is less than hoped for; but with further modifications the model could theoretically decide an objects material using an imported table into MATLAB.
